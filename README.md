# Jamboree Admission Predictor: A Linear Regression Approach

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive model development for Jamboree Education. The project focuses on building a linear regression model to estimate the probability of students getting admitted to Ivy League colleges. The analysis identifies significant predictors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, CGPA, and research experience, evaluating their impact on admission chances.

## Project Structure
- **Jamboree_Linear_Regression.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, visualizations, and model development using linear regression.
- **Data Folder**: Contains the dataset used in the analysis, detailing student academic scores and admission chances.

## Key Objectives
- **Predict Admission Probabilities**: Develop a linear regression model to predict the likelihood of a student being admitted to an Ivy League college based on academic and extracurricular variables.
- **Identify Significant Predictors**: Analyze which factors (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, research experience) most significantly influence admission chances.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the linear regression model using metrics like R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.

## Key Findings
- **GRE and CGPA Impact**: GRE scores and CGPA are the most significant predictors of admission probability, showing a strong correlation with admission chances.
- **Research Experience**: Students with research experience have a higher probability of admission, indicating the importance of extracurricular activities.
- **Model Accuracy**: The linear regression model achieves an R-squared value of 0.83, indicating a good fit for predicting admission probabilities.

## Recommendations
1. **Enhance Student Guidance**: Jamboree can use the predictive model to guide students on improving their admission chances by focusing on GRE scores and research experience.
2. **Develop a Student Admission Tool**: Implement the model on Jamboree's platform, allowing students to input their details and receive a probability score for Ivy League admissions.
3. **Targeted Marketing**: Use the model to identify students with lower admission probabilities and offer tailored coaching programs to improve their chances.
